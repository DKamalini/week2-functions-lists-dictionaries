# Week 2: Functions, Lists & Dictionaries

**Q1. How to define and call a function in Python?**

A function is defined using the def keyword and can be called by writing its name followed by parentheses.

**Example:**

def greet(name):

print("Hello", name)

greet("Jhon") # calling the function

# Output:Hello Jhon

**Q2. How to store values in Lists and Dictionaries in Python?**

List: A list is used to store multiple values in a single variable.

Lists are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

**Example (List):**

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print(fruits[0]) 

# Output: apple

Dictionary: A dictionary stores data in keyâ€“value pairs.

Keys are unique, and each key maps to a value.

**Example (Dictionary):**

student = {"name": "John", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}

print(student["name"]) 

# Output: John

 **Q3. Program to demonstrate Lists and Dictionaries in Python**

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print("List of fruits:", fruits)

student = {"name": "John", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}

print("Student details:", student)

**Output:**

List of fruits: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

Student details: {'name': 'John', 'age': 20, 'grade': 'A'}
